      I am excited to share that I have successfully completed my first milestone in this React project! This milestone involved setting up the development environment, creating a basic React application, and adding a simple "Hello World" message. I also got hands-on experience with Node.js and React, gaining insights into their core functionalities. With this foundation in place, I am now looking forward to the upcoming milestones and continuing my journey in building interactive and dynamic web    applications.
